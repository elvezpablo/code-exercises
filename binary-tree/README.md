A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a binary tree in which nodes that have lesser value are stored on the left while the nodes with a higher value are stored at the right.

[This ia a good write up of building CRUD operations on a BST](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/js-binary-search-trees)

Some notes about solving tree problems:

1. Trees and their nodes are often represented as Classes.
2. The solution to tree problems can often be solved with recursion
3. There is a pitfall of size with large recursive trees in that they can lead to memory overflows. In which case an iterative approach can be used.
